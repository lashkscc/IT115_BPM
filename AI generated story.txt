The sky shone bright with the morning sun. No one looked to their right. The air of the forest outside was thin and cold. Tatiana looked up at the sky.

"Ehehehe!" Her mother's face seemed to have been filled with astonishment. Irene stared down at the ground. Her mother was completely frozen. "…the sky is not the same. It's just a blank slate. And it is…"

Then, a hedgehog went to the mall to pick up his bags of popcorn, and then left to investigate. A police deputy approached him and took him away, but when he didn't return he was arrested. A badger then walked into a bar where he grabbed his $3 bill and tried to make a fight. This led to a brawl, and one man tried to stop him. But it was too late. 

The night before Irene walked out on the street, Irene decided to take the ferry home. A good day's sleep would have been nice. Irene turned down a cold bottle of rum, and just as she was about to take the bottle, an airy male voice.

"This is it, my man." He put the bottle into his pocket, pulled out the flask, and threw it into the air. 

Irene realized the male voice was her father. Memories of her childhood bubbled up. 

"Ohh, but, there's no reason." Irene said. ONSORED ONSORED ONSORED ONSORED
"There's no reason as of yet, isn't there? Just a little bit, huh?"
Reese leaned in to examine the bottle. She was in a very uncomfortable position, but with no sign of pain, and Irene was looking ahead from just outside of her grasp.
